## Background

We decided to venture into the world of data-mashing and data visualizations with the D3 JavaScript library. 

## Development/Contribution

Fork the Repo, submit a PR, hit one of us up on Twitter - the main objective of this project was to build something fun and to get people up during their afternoon lull.
